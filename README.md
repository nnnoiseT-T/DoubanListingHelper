[Douban](https://www.douban.com/) is the largest Chinese media database and social network for reviewing and categorizing music, movies/TVs, books, games, etc. Imagine RateYourMusic, Discogs, IMDB, Letterboxed, Goodreads, Steam... all in one plus you can post content, organize events, create discussion forums and much more. 

Music/file/book/game listings are the foundation Douban and are submited using a webform submitted by users manually. This is time-consuming and is subject to errors and format inconsistencies. This browser extension automate the process by scaping listing data from source sites and auto-fills forms on Douban. 

## Installation

- **Firefox store**: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/doubanlistinghelper/
- **Chrome store**: in review
- Install from Github: 
    - Click the green button to download the package.
    - Firefox: Unzip the package. Type "about:debugging" in the address bar. Click "This firefox" and then "Load Temporary Add-on". Select any file in the unzipped folder (for example, manifest.json). **You have to re-install every time you restart Firefox.**

### Reporting bugs

- Please open issues on Github or message me on Douban to report bugs. Please attach the source page link and your brower name when reporting. 
- **If you add listings regularly and want to help testing, please message me on Douban!**

## Usage

A "Collect" button appears on the upper-left corner of source pages. Clicking the botton collects listing data from the page, redirect to Douban, and auto-fill forms. It also downloads the cover image to the default download folder (Downloads, in my case). Users still have to upload the cover image manually (just select from the default download folder)

Supported source sites:
- Music: Bandcamp (album page), Discogs（master and release page), Apple Music (album page)
- Movie/TV: IMDB
- Book: In development
- Game: Steam

**Please double check auto filled entries and correct any errors. Accurate listing information is important for Douban.**

- **0.3** Re-wrote the whole thing to support other listings in the future. Fixed Chrome support. Fixed some bugs. Submitted to Firefox store and Chrome store。
- **0.2** Support Chrome。
- **0.1** Support Firefox and Bandcamp/Discogs/Apple Music. Will add support for Chrome and Soundcloud/Spotify.
